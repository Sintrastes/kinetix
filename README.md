# Kinetix

A small DSL in Kotlin for incremental computation, inspired by the [incremental](https://opensource.janestreet.com/incremental/) library for OCaml.

Can be thought of as a light-weight alternative to frameworks like [flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) or [rxJava](https://reactivex.io/), but more tailored to incrementally updating computations (think a generalized spreadsheet!) than to general concurrent reactivity. See this [blog post](https://blog.janestreet.com/breaking-down-frp/) from Jane Street for some more information on how this approach compares to related techniques like FRP (functional reactive programming).

Kinetix is in early stages of development, but contributions are welcome!
